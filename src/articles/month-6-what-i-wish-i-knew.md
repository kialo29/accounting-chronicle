Six months into my ACA journey, and I've already learned more than I expected — not just about accounting, but about how to actually survive this process. Here's everything I wish someone had told me before I started.

## 1. The Workload is Real (But Manageable)

Everyone warns you about how intense the ACA is, but until you're in it, you don't really get it. Balancing work, study, and having any kind of life takes genuine effort and planning.

What helped me: I stopped trying to study every single day. Instead, I block out proper study sessions 3-4 times a week and actually protect that time. Quality over quantity.

## 2. Your First Attempt Might Not Go Perfectly

I went into my first exams thinking I'd smash them. I didn't fail, but I definitely didn't smash them either. And that's okay. The pass rates exist for a reason — these exams are designed to be challenging.

The important thing is learning from each sitting and adjusting your approach. Which brings me to...

## 3. Find What Works For YOU

Everyone has opinions on the "right" way to study. Question banks vs reading. Morning study vs evening. Study groups vs solo.

The truth is, there's no universal answer. I spent the first few months trying other people's methods before realising I needed to figure out my own. Experiment early, track what actually sticks, and build your own system.

## 4. Your Mental Health Matters

This sounds obvious, but it's easy to forget when you're deep in revision. I've had weeks where I burned myself out trying to cram, only to retain almost nothing.

Taking breaks, exercising, seeing friends — these aren't luxuries you'll "get back to after exams." They're part of what makes sustainable studying possible.

## 5. The Community is Helpful

Whether it's colleagues going through the same thing, online forums, or channels like this one — you're not alone in this. Some of my best tips have come from random conversations with people a few exams ahead of me.

Don't be afraid to ask questions or share your struggles. Chances are, someone else is feeling exactly the same way.

## What's Next

I'll keep documenting this journey — the wins, the fails, and everything in between. If you're just starting out, I hope this helps you feel a bit more prepared than I was.

And if you're in the middle of it like me: we've got this. One exam at a time.
